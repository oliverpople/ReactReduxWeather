# ReduxWeather

A web app that displays weather forecasts for British cities. I built this app to learn React and Redux using Stephen Grider's Udemy course: https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter

Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start with the following:

```

```
You will also need to add your own API_KEY to src/actions/index.js file.

### Getting API key 

Visit https://openweathermap.org/forecast5#name5 and register to generate your own key for '5 day / 3 hour forecast by City Name'.
